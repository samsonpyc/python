#test part two

 this should only be the ase if you're amending an already-pushed commit. Generally you should never do that as you're 
then modifying published history. In your case however, you should be able to get away with push -f, which 
will overwrite the remote commit with your amended revision. 


#test part three

yup, yo hsould not do that pushing a commit, then changing it and trying to push it again ).
instead, you can roll back Git to your previous commit without changing the files, then creating a new commit.
This will create a new commit with the changes you were about to amend
